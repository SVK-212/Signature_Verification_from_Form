# Signature_Verification_from_Form
You are required to check a sample of signature form in the "rect" folder. 
Follow the format as in the form for making signatures.
Host the php.
Upload your sample image (with your signature) in the web form.
Hit the button and wait for the result.

Note: You are required to make your own "my_dumped_classifier.pkl" file which is based on your signatures.
Please check my other repository "Signature-Verification1" which will help you make your own custom "my_dumped_classifier.pkl" file.
